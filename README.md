# Snippet collection

This is a collection of VSCode snippets including multiple languages

## Why!?

The main idea was for me to preserve my knoledge this way I describe what I want to do in English and then I can use the snippets to do it in the programming language I want.

## How it works?

I catagorized snippets in [./snippets.json](./snippets.json) file under `!menu` section. This way I describe programming concepts shared by almost all programing languages and then I can implement them. For example I can write `!for loop` and the syntax for a for loop will be written in that language using VSCode snippets functionality.
